abstract = "In this study, gasoline–ethanol–water ternary mixtures were tested for stability, at three different temperatures, three water qualities, two gasoline compositions and three additives. Then, a specific mixture of 60:40 gasoline–ethanol-10% hydrous (E40h), was burned in a stationary automotive Otto engine. Measurements of exhaust emissions (NOx, NO, HC, CO2, CO, O2), horsepower, fuel consumption and other parameters were taken through the λ scale and compared to those derived from the gasoline (E0) and 60:40(E40) gasoline–anhydrous ethanol fuels. The engine, a 997cc VVTi Toyota gasoline engine without catalytic converter, had to be thoroughly retuned but not modified for these three different fuels. The experimental results show an impressive reduction of NOx emissions for hydrous ethanol mixture and other less significant changes for the rest of the emissions. Also, the gravimetric fuel consumption is significantly higher for both anhydrous and hydrous ethanol mixtures due to the lower heating value of ethanol and zero heating value of water."
